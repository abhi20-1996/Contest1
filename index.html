    <h1>Digital Revolution: Technology, Power, & You</h1>
    <p>The digital revolution has already 
        changed how people live, work, and 
        communicate. And itâ€™s only just 
        getting started. But the same 
        technologies that have the potential
         to help billions of people live 
         happier, healthier, and more productive
          lives are also creating new challenges
           for citizens and governments around 
           the world. From election meddling 
           to data breaches and cyberattacks, 
           recent events have shown that 
           technology is changing how we think
            about privacy, national security, 
            and maybe even democracy itself. In 
            this project, we examine challenges in five
             key areas that will shape the future of the
              digital age: justice system, impact on democracy,
               global security and international conflict, the impact
                of automations and AI on the jobs marketplace, identity,
                 and privacy. Explore provocative and through-provoking 
                 topics on how technology impacts our lives</p>
